	Abstract = {Explore the world of Virtual Reality by building immersive and fun VR projects using Unity 3DAbout This BookLearn the basic principles of virtual reality applications and get to know how they differ from games and desktop appsBuild various types of VR experiences, including diorama, first-person characters, riding on rails, 360 degree projections, and social VRA project-based guide that teaches you to use Unity to develop VR applications, which can be experienced with devices such as the Oculus Rift or Google CardboardIn DetailWhat is consumer ``virtual reality''? Wearing a head-mounted display you view stereoscopic 3D scenes. You can look around by moving your head, and walk around using hand controls or motion sensors. You are engaged in a fully immersive experience. On the other hand, Unity is a powerful game development engine that provides a rich set of features such as visual lighting, materials, physics, audio, special effects, and animation for creating 2D and 3D games. Unity 5 has become the leading platform for building virtual reality games, applications and experiences for this new generation of consumer VR devices.Using a practical and project-based approach, this book will educate you about the specifics of virtual reality development in Unity.You will learn how to use Unity to develop VR applications which can be experienced with devices such as the Oculus Rift or Google Cardboard. We will then learn how to engage with virtual worlds from a third person and first person character point of view. Furthermore, you will explore the technical considerations especially important and possibly unique to VR. The projects in the book will demonstrate how to build a variety of VR experiences. You will be diving into the Unity 3D game engine via the interactive Unity Editor as well as C-Sharp programming.By the end of the book, you will be equipped to develop rich, interactive virtual reality experiences using Unity.So, let's get to it!What You Will LearnCreate 3D scenes with Unity and Blender while learning about world space and scaleBuild and run VR applications for consumer headsets including Oculus Rift and Google CardboardBuild interactive environments with physics, gravity, animations, and lighting using the Unity engineExperiment with various user interface (UI) techniques that you can use in your VR applicationsImplement the first-person and third-person experiences that use only head motion gestures for inputCreate animated walkthroughs, use 360-degree media, and build multi-user social VR experiencesLearn about the technology and psychology of VR including rendering, performance and VR motion sicknessGain introductory and advanced experience in Unity programming with the C\# languageWho This Book Is ForIf you're a non-programmer unfamiliar with 3D computer graphics, or experienced in both but new to virtual reality, and are interested in building your own VR games or applications then this book is for you. Any experience in Unity is an advantage.Style and approachThis book takes a practical, project-based approach to teach specifics of virtual reality development in Unity.

@misc{texture,
	Abstract = {Texture gradient is the distortion in size which closer objects have compared to objects farther away. It also involves groups of objects appearing denser as they move farther away. Also could be explained by noticing a certain amount of detail depending on how close something is, giving a sense of depth perception. There are three main forms of texture gradient: density, perspective, and distortion of texture elements.
Texture gradient is carefully used in the painting Paris Street, Rainy Day by Gustave Caillebotte.
Texture gradient was used in a study of child psychology in 1976 and studied by Sidney Weinstein in 1957.
In 2000, a paper about the texture gradient equation, wavelets, and shape from texture was released by Maureen Clerc and St{\'e}phane Mallat.},

@article{bernatchez,
	Abstract = {The design of virtual reality user interfaces
(VRUI) is still an open field of research and development.
One category of VRUI is the 3D floating menus that can be
manipulated by users in free space. These menus can
contain various controls such as buttons, sliders, and text.
This article presents an experimental study that aims at
testing the impact of five spatial reference frames on human
performance with VRUI. Fifteen subjects participated in the
study. Wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) and
tracking hardware, they were asked to move a slider on a
floating menu in a 3D virtual space. The menus were
completely virtual such that no physical surface was
providing haptic feedback to the user. Main results show
that the reference frame has a determinant impact on task
execution time, positional accuracy and user preference. We
also found a link between the number of degrees of freedom
shared between these reference frame and user
performance. Results also show that user preference can
greatly differ from experimental results obtained by
measuring task completion times and positional accuracy.},

	Abstract = {This book gives a well rounded yet in depth study of virtual reality, specifically the relationship between human beings and virtual environments. This source has a great introduction that covers many of the crucial definitions one should be familiar with when referencing virtual reality. The work then moves on to cover human behaviors in real world environments and how we can begin to analyze and model that within a virtual system. It breaks down the major human senses used in virtual reality and gives biological explanations on how each of these systems function and operate. Another relevant chapter this book offers is an in depth discussion of immersion and presence within virtual reality. This source is written for people well versed in the concepts of virtual reality and looking to dig deeper into the role human senses play in the relationship between human beings and virtual environments. This is a fantastic source for my paper because it can be referenced to write about the human senses, and why they must be understood to model effective virtual reality.},

The primary objective of the article is to supply an overview of virtual reality as a whole. This source gives an extraordinary introduction that discusses the rich background and history of the field of virtual reality. However, what stands out about this article is how it discusses the characteristics a virtual reality system must have in order to exploit spatial and perceptual skills. It is emphasized how important sensory feedback, specifically position, touch, and force are when designing these virtual systems. The article is written for people relatively familiar with virtual reality but seeking a relatable and reader friendly discussion on the topic. This source will be valuable because it speaks specifically on what a virtual reality system must have in order to recognize the perceptual and spatial skills of the users. The weakness of this article is that it is slightly outdated in terms of the new technology virtual reality has developed since the article.},

@incollection{mihelj_apps,
	Abstract = {This text begins by offering a thorough introduction into the world of virtual reality. The introduction includes the basic definitions of virtual reality, its history, and most important applications. The source then dives into on all the relevant topics concerning virtual reality including many of the mathematical tools and theories needed to understand rigid body dynamics, motion, inertial properties, transformations, quaternions and collision detection. Although many of these mathematical tools and theories are not needed for my studies, they will serve as a helpful reference when further knowledge is needed. Other relevant areas this book covers are motion tracking, modeling, rendering, haptic modality, and interaction in VR. The emphasis of this source is on the human senses used to interpret information within virtual environments and the mathematical tools used to model these behaviors.
This source is written for people looking to really explore and gain advanced knowledge into virtual reality and the technologies that power it. This text will be useful because of its wide span of concepts pertinent to virtual reality and the amount of depth and detail it assesses and explains these concepts. 
The weaknesses of this text are the focus on some topics not relevant to me, such as augmented reality.},

	Abstract = {This source offers an extremely focused and technical study on the role haptic technology plays in virtual reality. The first chapter offers a broad introduction discussing human factors in virtual reality, rending in virtual reality, and current display technologies. The remainder of the source gives a massively in depth guide to the human haptic system, haptic displays, haptic rendering, collision detection, and haptic interfaces. This source is clearly intended for people specifically looking to further their knowledge of haptic technologies and the crucial role they hold in virtual reality. This source will be extremely useful due to its focus on haptic theory, specifically the chapter concerning the human haptic and motor systems. The weakness of this article is the amount of depth it offers and the over complex nature of many of the chapters which, are too specific to be of use in my studies.},

@incollection{miura,
	Abstract = {The progress of new technologies makes virtual reality (VR) easier, and inexpensive head-mounted displays (HMDs) accelerate the development of advanced VR services. The advantage of the technologies is to offer the better immersion of a VR world, to use natural user interface (NUI) devices and to operate them with a user's gesture. The problem to use NUI devices for VR-based services is to take into account various types of NUI devices. We need to consider how a user to use NUI devices in a proper way, in particular, when an HMD limits his/her view of the real world. Our approach to solve the problem is to use an affordance that offers implicit information how to navigate VR-based services. However, there are a little researches to investigate the relationship between different types of NUI devices and the design of proper affordances to navigate VR-based services. The paper provides some insights how respective types of NUI devices influence affordance design to navigate VR-based services. For extracting effective insights, we have developed two VR-based services, where we discuss two types of operating methods and three types of affordances for respective operating methods are examined. Also, we chose two types of NUI devices for navigating the VR-based services. Then, we conducted some experiments to extract some insights as a guideline to develop future VR-based services. The result shows that the differences among respective NUI devices may not significantly influence affordance design, however have strong effects on understanding how to navigate VR-based services. The understanding also affects how each user prefers which NUI devices, because NUI devices require us to use gesture to navigate the services, but the intuition that differs in each individual is important.},

@incollection{sherman,
	Abstract = {Understanding Virtual Reality arrives at a time when the technologies behind virtual reality have advanced to the point that it is possible to develop and deploy meaningful, productive virtual reality applications. The aim of this thorough, accessible exploration is to help you take advantage of this moment, equipping you with the understanding needed to identify and prepare for ways VR can be used in your field, whatever your field may be.By approaching VR as a communications medium, the authors have created a resource that will remain relevant even as the underlying technologies evolve. You get a history of VR, along with a good look at systems currently in use. However, the focus remains squarely on the application of VR and the many issues that arise in the application design and implementation, including hardware requirements, system integration, interaction techniques, and usability. This book also counters both exaggerated claims for VR and the view that would reduce it to entertainment, citing dozens of real-world examples from many different fields and presenting (in a series of appendices) four in-depth application case studies.* Substantive, illuminating coverage designed for technical and business readers and well-suited to the classroom.* Examines VR's constituent technologies, drawn from visualization, representation, graphics, human-computer interaction, and other fields, and explains how they are being united in cohesive VR systems.* Via a companion Web site, provides additional case studies, tutorials, instructional materials, and a link to an open-source VR programming system.},
